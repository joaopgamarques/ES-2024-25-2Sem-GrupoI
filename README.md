## Project Overview
This project loads property data from a CSV file (e.g., Madeira-Moodle-1.1.csv),
represents them as graphs for adjacency, merges contiguous parcels under the same owner,
and suggests potential property swaps to maximize average property size.

## Build & Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joaopgamarques/ES-Project-TerritoryManagement.git
