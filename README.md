# ES-Project-TerritoryManagement

A software application to **manage and optimize property data** in Portugal, featuring:

- **Graph-Based Adjacency Checks**
- **Owner-Adjacency Graph** (owners connected if they have adjacent parcels)
- **Property Merging** (planned)
- **Average Area Calculations**
- **Exports to Gephi** for advanced visualization

---

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and improving **territorial management** by loading, processing, and visualizing property records. You can **import CSV** data (e.g., `Madeira-Moodle-1.1.csv`) into various graph structures to detect adjacency, explore ownership patterns, and ultimately propose land swaps or merges to optimize property usage.

---

## Key Classes

1. **`CSVFileReader` / `CSVFileWriter`**
    - **`CSVFileReader`**: Imports a semicolon-delimited CSV into a list of `PropertyRecord` objects.
    - **`CSVFileWriter`**: Exports `PropertyRecord` objects back to CSV.

2. **`PropertyRecord`**
    - Immutable model class holding property attributes (objectID, parcelID, geometry, owner, parish, etc.).

3. **`PropertyUtils`**
    - Static methods for filtering, adjacency checks, and other property-related utilities.

4. **`GeometryUtils`**
    - Handles low-level geometry operations (parsing WKT, creating envelopes, checking adjacency) via **LocationTech JTS**.

5. **`PropertyGraph`**
    - A **JGraphT**-based graph where each property is a **vertex**, and **edges** represent adjacency.
    - Uses an **R-tree** (`STRtree`) to efficiently find candidate neighbors in large datasets.

6. **`OwnerGraph`**
    - Another **JGraphT**-based graph, but each node represents an **owner**.
    - Creates edges between owners who share **at least one pair** of adjacent properties.

7. **`GraphVisualization`**
    - Builds an **interactive GraphStream** visualization from a `PropertyGraph`.
    - Displays parcels (nodes) and their adjacency (edges), applying simple color rules for connected vs. isolated parcels.

8. **`ExportToGephiDemo`**
    - Demonstrates creating a **GraphStream** graph from a filtered property list (e.g., by parish).
    - Exports the graph to `.gexf` for use in **Gephi**, enabling advanced layout and analytics.

9. **`Graph`**
    - A simpler adjacency-list approach, linking `PropertyRecord` nodes if they share a boundary.
    - Currently uses an O(N²) check; future improvements may include spatial indexing.

## Installation & Dependencies

All dependencies are managed via **Maven**. You’ll find them in the [pom.xml](pom.xml). Major libraries include:

- **OpenCSV** for CSV parsing.
- **LocationTech JTS** for geometry operations (e.g., adjacency, intersection checks).
- **SLF4J + Logback** for logging.
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing.
- **JGraphT** for constructing and storing property graphs.
- **GraphStream** for visualizing and exporting `.gexf`.

## Planned Features

**Property Merging**  
Combine contiguous parcels owned by the same owner into a larger, single record.

**Swap Suggestions**  
Identify potential property exchanges between owners to maximize the average property area per owner.

---

## Known Issues & Incomplete Features

**Graph Construction**
- The `Graph` class (adjacency list) is ongoing; for large datasets, a more efficient approach (e.g., spatial index) is recommended.
- The `PropertyGraph` class works but may need further testing for edge cases and performance tuning.
- The `OwnerGraph` class currently links owners with adjacent properties, but further optimization or additional ownership checks may be desired.

**Property Merging**
- Not fully integrated; geometry-based merging logic remains a placeholder.

**Swap Suggestions**
- Algorithmic design is in progress; not implemented yet.

**Tests**
- Some integration tests (involving both geometry checks and adjacency) remain to be written.
- Additional unit tests for edge cases are on the roadmap.
