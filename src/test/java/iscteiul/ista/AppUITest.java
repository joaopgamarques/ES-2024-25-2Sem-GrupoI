/**
 * Basic JUnit test class for {@link AppUI}, the Swing-based user interface
 * of the ES-Project-TerritoryManagement application.
 *
 * <p>This class demonstrates how to perform simple UI tests without
 * specialized libraries. We check the following:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Whether the UI can be instantiated without errors.</li>
 *   <li>Whether the title and dimensions are as expected after {@code pack()}. </li>
 *   <li>(Optional) Accessing and verifying components, if getters are available.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> For more thorough UI interaction tests (e.g., simulating clicks
 * and checking output), consider libraries such as AssertJ Swing or FEST.</p>
